#Optimizers
-Find minimum values of functions

-Build parametrized models based on data

-Refine allocations to stocks in portfolios

##How to use
1. Provide a function to minimize
2. Provide an initial guess
3. Call the optimizer

##Convex Problems
* Draw line between any two points
* Convex if line is above graph

##Build a parameterized model
* f(x) = c0 * x + c1

What are we minimizing?

Sum squares of errors or abs() of errors
